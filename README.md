# Study of the performance of Negative Selection Algorithm (NSA) with enhacement via Reinforcement Learning (RL)

## Repository containing the scripts and data required to run experiments for the study

This repo contains two folders - scripts and data. The python scripts can be executed using a simple `python <script-name>` command, for instance `python classifier_rl_unix.py`. For each experiment the values of n and r (or their ranges), were changed within the script themselves. 

The Unix system calls and Twitter sentiment data is stored in the data folder, while for AG News, an internet connection is needed as the data is pulled from Hugging Face when executing the script.

An example successful start to a run is shown below for the Twitter dataset.
